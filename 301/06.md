1. **Who is Roy Fielding?**
   Roy Fielding is a smart person who helped create the rules for how computers talk to each other on the internet. He's a big deal in the world of computer science.

2. **Why don't our usual methods work for talking to all machines in the world?**
   The ways we learn in class might work fine for small tasks, but when you want to connect with any computer on the planet, things can get messy. That's where REST comes in to make everything more organized and understandable.

3. **What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?**
   HTTP is like the language that computers use to chat on the web. Fielding and friends played a part in making the rules for this language, and it's what makes the internet work.

4. **What does a GET do?**
   Think of a GET like asking for information. It's when you want to see something on a website, like a page or data. You're just looking, not changing anything.

5. **What does a POST do?**
   POST is for sending data to a server. It's like when you send a message or fill out a form online. You're giving the server some information to deal with.

6. **What does PUT do?**
   PUT is like telling the server, "Here's the new version of something." If you have a file or data on the server, you can use PUT to replace it with a fresh copy.

7. **What does PATCH do?**
   PATCH is similar to PUT, but instead of sending a whole new thing, you're sending just the changes. It's like editing a specific part of a document without rewriting the entire thing. This saves time and effort.

So, REST is a neat way for computers to chat on the internet using rules and methods like GET, POST, PUT, and PATCH, and it was partly created by Roy Fielding. It keeps things organized and makes the internet work smoothly.
