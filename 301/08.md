# API's

1. **What does REST stand for?**
   - REST stands for Representational State Transfer.

2. **REST APIs are designed around a ____.**
   - REST APIs are designed around a set of architectural principles, including a client-server architecture, statelessness, and a uniform interface.

3. **What is an identifier of a resource? Give an example.**
   - An identifier of a resource in a RESTful API is typically represented as a URI (Uniform Resource Identifier). For example, in a RESTful API for managing books, the URI for a specific book might be: "https://api.example.com/books/123".

4. **What are the most common HTTP verbs?**
   - The most common HTTP verbs used in RESTful APIs are:
     1. GET: Used to retrieve resource representations.
     2. POST: Used to create new resources.
     3. PUT: Used to update or replace existing resources.
     4. DELETE: Used to remove resources.
     5. PATCH: Used to make partial updates to resources.

5. **What should the URIs be based on?**
   - URIs in REST should be based on nouns, representing resources, and not actions. They should be designed to be hierarchical and follow a logical structure. For example, for a RESTful API for managing products, a good URI for retrieving product information might be: "https://api.example.com/products/123".

6. **Give an example of a good URI.**
   - For example, in a RESTful API for managing products, a good URI for retrieving product information might be: "https://api.example.com/products/123".

7. **What does it mean to have a ‘chatty’ web API? Is this a good or a bad thing?**
   - A 'chatty' web API is one that requires a large number of small, fine-grained requests to retrieve or manipulate data. This is generally considered a bad thing because it can lead to increased latency and network overhead, making the API less efficient and scalable. It's often better to design APIs that allow clients to achieve their goals with fewer, more comprehensive requests.

8. **What status code does a successful GET request return?**
   - A successful GET request typically returns an HTTP status code of 200 (OK).

9. **What status code does an unsuccessful GET request return?**
   - An unsuccessful GET request may return various status codes depending on the specific error, but a common one is 404 (Not Found) when the requested resource does not exist.

10. **What status code does a successful POST request return?**
    - A successful POST request typically returns an HTTP status code of 201 (Created) along with a URI for the newly created resource in the "Location" header.

11. **What status code does a successful DELETE request return?**
    - A successful DELETE request returns an HTTP status code of 204 (No Content) to indicate that the resource has been successfully deleted.
