Q1. To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside what element?

1. To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside the `<a>` (anchor) element.

Q2. The href attribute contains what information?

2. The `href` attribute in the `<a>` element contains the URL or destination to which the link points. It specifies the web address or file location the link will navigate to when clicked.

3. To ensure links on our web pages are accessible to all readers, we can:

   - Provide meaningful link text: Use descriptive and contextually relevant text within the `<a>` element.
   - Use proper HTML structure: Ensure semantic HTML and appropriate nesting of elements.
   - Add alternative text to images used as links: Utilize the `alt` attribute for images within anchor elements.
   - Test with screen readers: Regularly test the accessibility of links using screen reader software.

4. "Normal flow" refers to the default layout behavior of HTML elements without any special positioning applied. In normal flow, elements are displayed one after another vertically, and they will take up the width of their parent container unless modified by CSS properties.

5. Block-level elements typically start on a new line and take up the full width of their parent container, stacking on top of each other. Inline elements, on the other hand, do not start on a new line and only occupy as much width as necessary.

6. "Static" positioning is the default for every HTML element. Elements with static positioning follow the normal flow and are not affected by positioning properties like `position: absolute` or `position: fixed`.

7. Some advantages of using absolute positioning on an element include precise control over its placement on the page, the ability to layer elements on top of each other, and positioning relative to a specified ancestor element rather than the viewport.

8. The key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning is that fixed positioning positions an element relative to the viewport, so it remains fixed in its position even when the page is scrolled. Absolute positioning, on the other hand, positions an element relative to its nearest positioned ancestor, which may not be the viewport.

9. A function declaration defines a function in JavaScript, specifying its name, parameters, and code block. A function invocation, on the other hand, calls and executes the function with specific arguments (if any) and returns a result if the function has a return statement.

10. In programming, a parameter is a variable in a function definition, while an argument is a value or expression that is passed to a function when it is called. Parameters act as placeholders for arguments, and they receive the values passed during the function invocation.

11. Two benefits of pair programming are:
    a. Improved Code Quality: Pair programming often results in higher-quality code as two developers collaborate, catch each other's mistakes, and provide immediate feedback.
    b. Learning and Skill Sharing: Pair programming allows for knowledge sharing and learning from each other's expertise, which can accelerate personal and collective skill development.

These benefits can help individuals on their coding journey by fostering a collaborative and supportive learning environment, reducing errors, and facilitating faster skill acquisition through shared experiences and insights.
